## init

The `init` command is used to initialize configuration and dependencies for a new project.

It installs dependencies, adds the `clx` utils, configures `tailwind.config.js`, and CSS variables for the project.

```bash
npx ever-ui-clx@0.2.1 init
```

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers

Configure the import alias for components: â€º @/components
Configure the import alias for utils: â€º @/lib/utils

```bash
npx ever-ui-clx@0.2.1 add demo-[component]
npx ever-ui-clx@0.2.1 add demo-[demo-component]
