## init (Next.js)

To init Ever UI, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx ever-ui-clx@0.2.1 init
```

Running this command will create these files:

{/* <ComponentDemo name="demos/ui/demo-tree-view-nested" align="start" justify="start"/> */}


## clx

See how you can <Link href="/docs/using-clx">use Clx</Link> here.


## components.json

The `components.json` file holds configuration for your project.

We use it to understand how your project is set up and how to generate components customized for your project.

{/* <Callout className="mt-6">
  Note: The `components.json` file is optional and **only required if you're
  using the CLI** to add components to your project. If you're using the copy
  and paste method, you don't need this file.
